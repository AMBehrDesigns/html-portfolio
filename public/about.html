    <h1>Aidan Behrens</h1>
    <h2>They/Them</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name's Aidan. I am an actor by training but am working
    toward becoming a front-end developer as a way to help actors and creatives
    build websites that are as unique as they are. I'm located in Brooklyn, NY, so 
    feel free to say hi if you're ever in the area. I like coffee, parks, and 
    exploring the city I've grown to love. 
    </p>
